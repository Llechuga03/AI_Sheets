1. Need to fix the issues with docker, which at the moment have to do with not being able to write to a read only file.
The file in this case is the SheetsAI.db. 
    - First thing to look into would be the privileges that a user has based on the DockerFile. The docker init command
    sets these privileges for you, so reading up on the documentation could help determine what changes need to be made. 
2. Need to figure out if I need to include database security and if so how.
3. This is just a question but are the databases shared between anyone? I think the way it works is whenever a user creates a clone of this
repo they can add any files to the data folder and then the database will be specific to their files. 
4. Once these issues have been fixed, I should run the application again and test it thoroughouly to ensure application runs smoothly.
